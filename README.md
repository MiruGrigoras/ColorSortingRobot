# ColorSortingRobot
Arduino programmed robot which sorts colored candy.

How it works:
- there are 4 color categories;
- the candy is brought under the color sensor;
- the LCD displays what color the candy is;
- the stepper underneath carries 4 cups and rotates the color-corresponding cup under the hole from the level above;
- the servo moves the candy further towards the hole for it to be dropped in the correct cup;
